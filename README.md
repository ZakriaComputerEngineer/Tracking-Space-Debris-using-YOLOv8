Dataset Preparation

Initial Dataset: Utilized an existing dataset but chose not to use its labels due to their subpar quality.

Data Augmentation: Applied horizontal and vertical flips, and resized all images to 640x640 pixels, expanding the dataset to 2467 images.

Data Split: Divided the dataset into training (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) sets using Roboflow, ensuring a comprehensive and balanced dataset for model training.
